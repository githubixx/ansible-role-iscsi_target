# The iSCSI target(s) is/are configured via "iscsi_targets" nested variable.
# A quite minimal setup looks like this example:
#
# iscsi_targets:
#   - name: "iqn.2021-11.blog.tauceti:{{ ansible_facts['nodename'] }}"
#     disks:
#       - name: lun_node1
#         path: /dev/vdb
#         type: block
#         lunid: 0
#     initiators:
#       - name: iqn.2021-07.blog.tauceti:node1
#         authentication:
#           userid: node1user
#           password: node1pw
#           userid_mutual: node1sharedkey
#           password_mutual: node1sharedsecret
#         mapped_luns:
#           - mapped_lunid: 0
#             lunid: 0
#     portals:
#       - ip: "0.0.0.0"

# "targetcli-fb" package is needed to configure iSCSI target. For Archlinux
# this package needs to be installed from AUR. This requires an AUR install
# helper like "yay", "paru", "pacaur", "trizen" or "pikaur". If such a helper
# is already installed on the target host then there is no need to install it
# via this role. In this case "iscsi_archlinux_aur_helper" needs to be
# commented and this role will skip the installation of an AUR helper.
# The install task picks one of the AUR helper mentioned above (in that order)
# to install the iSCSI packages.
iscsi_archlinux_aur_helper: yay

# While Ansible expects to SSH as root, makepkg or AUR helpers do not allow
# executing operations as root, they fail with "you cannot perform this
# operation as root". It is therefore recommended to have a user, which
# is non-root but has no need for password. If "iscsi_archlinux_aur_helper"
# variable is set it is assumed that the AUR helper user doesn't exist yet
# so it will be created. The user will be part of the "wheel" group.
